# **Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) Best Practices Badge**

**Question:** What is the current OpenSSF Best Practices status for the project?

## **Overview**
The OpenSSF Best Practices Badge, from the Linux Foundation, allows open source projects to voluntarily self-certify that they follow open source best practices. Projects can use the OpenSSF Best Practices Badge web application to explain how they adhere to each best practice. A project receives a passing badge if it meets all the required criteria. 

The badge focuses on cybersecurity in open source software, helping to ensure that projects follow best practices for producing secure, high-quality software.

### **Objectives**
The **OpenSSF Best Practices Badge**:
- Indicates a project's compliance with "open source project best practices" as defined by the Linux Foundation’s core infrastructure initiative.
- Encourages open source projects to produce secure software by adhering to established best practices.
- Enables consumers to assess which open source projects are more likely to produce secure, reliable software based on their compliance with these best practices.

### **Data Collection Strategies**
To assess a project’s OpenSSF Best Practices status:
- Projects receive a passing badge if they meet all required criteria.
- Status of each criterion is categorized as 'Met', 'Unmet', 'N/A', or 'Unknown'. 
- Criteria are grouped into four categories: 'MUST', 'SHOULD', 'SUGGESTED', and 'FUTURE'.
- To obtain a badge, all MUST and MUST NOT criteria must be met. All SHOULD criteria must either be met or have a documented rationale for not implementing them. SUGGESTED criteria are optional and can be rated as either met or unmet.
- Advanced badges (silver and gold) are available for projects that meet additional criteria.

For further information, refer to [OpenSSF’s API documentation](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en).

### **Filters**
The metric can be filtered by:
- Badge level (Passing, Silver, Gold)
- Project type or focus area (e.g., cybersecurity projects)
- Criteria status (Met, Unmet, N/A, Unknown)
- Compliance trends over time
